### Exercise 1

Load the package and make a connection

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(sparklyr)
sc = spark_connect(master = "local")
```
In this exercise, we're going to use the `nycflights13` data set. Look at
the associated help page `?nycflights13::flights` to get an overview of the data set.
Load the `dplyr` package
```{r eval=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
```
and copy the dataframe across
```{r  eval=FALSE}
flights_tbl = copy_to(sc, nycflights13::flights, "flights")
```
List the available tables using `src_tbls(sc)`. Look

### Exercise 2

1. Using the `filter` dplyr function, select flights where the airtime was greater than 10 hours

```{r  eval=FALSE}
flights_tbl %>% filter(air_time > 10 * 60)
```


2. Lets investigate how delay varies with day of the month. The following code groups by 
day of the week, then works out the conditional arrivial delay

```{r eval=FALSE}
delay = flights_tbl %>% 
  group_by(day) %>%
  summarise(delay = mean(arr_delay))
```

Now compare
```{r eval=FALSE}
delay
delay_collect = delay %>% collect()
```
What's the difference? We can the delays easily ggplot2 (or base graphics)
```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(delay, aes(day, delay)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
```
3. Produce a similar plot for `dep_delay`


4. **Tricky question**: Create a boxplot graphic where the x-axis is day of the week and the y-axis is the
delay.
