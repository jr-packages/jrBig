<!-- ``` -->

## Exercise 1

In the notes we generated a numeric data set. Here we'll repeat the timings, but 
with characters. First generate a simple data set.
```{r eval=FALSE}
x = as.character(runif(1e6))
x[sample(1e6, 1e5)] = NA # 10% NAs
dd =  as.data.frame(replicate(10, x))
```
  * Time writing/reading the data frame to a file.
  * Compare the file size of the resulting feather, RData and csv files.

Hint: It's worth reading the RStudio [blog](https://blog.rstudio.org/) from time 
to time.

## Exercise 2 (bonus)

You can also use environments to speed up passing data (Bioconductor does this). 
Unfortunately, we don't have time to cover environments in this course - 
see our [Advanced R programming](www.jumpingrivers.com)

To create an enviroment we use the `new.env()` function

```{r}
e = new.env()
```

and then place a matrix into that enviroment
```{r}
x = matrix(runif(10000), ncol=10)
e$x = x
```

Next we'll create two functions to benchmark
```{r}
f = function(x) {
  x[1,1] = 1
  x
}
g = function(e) e$x[1,1] = 1
```
Then time as before
```{r eval=FALSE}
system.time({
  for(i in 1:100000) {
    x = f(x)
  }
})

system.time({
  for(i in 1:100000) {
    g(e)
  }
})
```
Repeat the above task but change the matrix to a data frame.

The reason that using an environment is more efficient is because we pass by reference (again we don't cover that today)
