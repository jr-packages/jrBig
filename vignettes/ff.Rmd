## Exercise 1

1. Load the `ff` package
    ```{r message=FALSE}
    library("ff")
    ```
1. Obtain the filename of the example data set
    ```{r}
    filename = jrBig::get_rand()
    ```
and compare the read times of `read.csv.ffdf` and `read.csv`
```{r echo=FALSE}
ffx = read.csv.ffdf(file = filename, header = TRUE)
dd = read.csv(file = filename, header = TRUE)
```

## Exercise 2

Suppose we have $n$ chunks. Can you think of how we could calculate

  * The mean
  * The variance
  * The median

If it makes things easier, set $n=5$
