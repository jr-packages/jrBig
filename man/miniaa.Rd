\description{
Providers of health care in the USA are made publicly 
available by the US government. 
The resulting datasets are large (over 4 GB unzipped) and can be
accessed from http://download.cms.gov/nppes/NPI_Files.html.
In this dataset each row is a registered health care provider.
The columns contain information on these providers, including name,
address and telephone number. 
Because there are so many column variables (329) much of the data is
redundant. This data set is a sub set of the real data sets
